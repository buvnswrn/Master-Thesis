## AJAN Data

This folder contains all the relevant and necessary data to test the experiments.

### Prefix Meanings:
__Real_World\___ - Real world experiment carried out in laboratory environment on real drone for Gesture Problem

__Omniverse\___ - Files for the experiment to work in the Omniverse scene (the behavior tree is slightly different since the get-all-objects endpoint does not work inside the omniverse scene)

Other files are meant to be worked in the Unity Robotics warehouse scene.
In all the scenes, Trial is the one meant for experiment which would eventually call the other behavior trees
